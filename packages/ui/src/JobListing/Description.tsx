        About Thinkmill

        Thinkmill is a design and development consultancy. We make software and platforms with long-term clients and partners, including Atlassian, Reckon, Enlitic, Vocal, and more.
        We're also behind KeystoneJS, a popular open source CMS Application Framework.
        Our growing team (50 people) works across a wide range of domains: accounting software, medical AI, online publishing, IoT and connected products, and more.
        We're an engineering-led company, with extensive experience developing Design System and Front-end architecture.
        Our model is not typical: we partner with companies both locally and internationally to augment or be their design and technology team. This means we get the best of both worlds: the depth of long-term product development usually restricted to single-product companies, as well as the diversity of multi-client agencies.
        We're major Open Source contributors to, including KeystoneJS, Emotion (css-in-js), react-select, monorepo.guide, and many more
        We organise popular meet-ups and conferences, including React Sydney, Design System Meetup, and ReactConfAU
        We've been featured in AFRâ€™s Fast100 companies in 2018, 2019, 2021
